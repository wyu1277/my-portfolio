          <p className="font-Futura-PT">Le Waf is a renowned artisanal waffle brand, known for its premium and handcrafted waffles. They have gained popularity and recognition after being featured in a food network show hosted by Guy Fieri. However, their current website didn't align with their desired premium branding and fails to convey the message of their careful craftsmanship. Le Waf wants a complete website redesign that showcases their commitment to quality and delivers a seamless online shopping experience to customers.</p>

          <li className="font-Futura-PT font-semibold mt-5">Redesign the website to reflect Le Waf's premium branding and artisanal essence.</li>
          <li className="font-Futura-PT font-semibold  mt-5">Create a user-friendly and visually appealing ecommerce platform to boost online sales.</li>
          <li className="font-Futura-PT font-semibold  mt-5">Enhance the overall user experience to align with the brand's reputation for excellence.</li>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p className="font-Futura-PT mt-5">I started by conducting a thorough analysis of Le Waf's current website, as well as competitor analysis of other premium artisanal food brands. I also reviewed customer feedback and user behavior data to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.</p>
          <p className="font-Futura-PT my-5">Through the process of sketching and exploring page organization, I discovered that the optimal approach was to utilize well-defined modules with abundant white space. Additionally, I identified consistent design patterns tailored for seamless information browsing. My design strategy revolved around elevating the brand's image through elegant visuals, intuitive navigation, and a focus on storytelling. I aimed to create an immersive experience that resonates with the premium nature of Le Waf's artisanal waffles. Two key personas guided my design decisions to ensure the new website would cater to the needs of Le Waf's target audience.</p>

          <p className="font-Futura-PT mt-5">I created my high fidelity mockups in Figma and then imported them into Invision to allow the engineers to inspect the file and export the HTML and CSS code.

I conducted a UX review of each front-end ticket that was implemented to ensure it was aligned with the designs before it went live.</p>
