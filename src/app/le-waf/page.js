          <h3>Client Background</h3>
          <p>Le Waf is a renowned artisanal waffle brand, known for its premium and handcrafted waffles. They have gained popularity and recognition after being featured in a food network show hosted by Guy Fieri. However, their current website didn't align with their desired premium branding and fails to convey the message of their careful craftsmanship. Le Waf wants a complete website redesign that showcases their commitment to quality and delivers a seamless online shopping experience to customers.</p>

          <h1>Developing the Designs</h1>
          <p>I created my high fidelity mockups in Figma and then imported them into Invision to allow the engineers to inspect the file and export the HTML and CSS code.

          I worked very closely with the Front End team to spec out any missing interactions that were not covered in the high fidelity mockups. I conducted a UX review of each front-end ticket that was implemented to ensure it was aligned with the designs before it went live.</p>
